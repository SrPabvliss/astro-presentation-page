	mainContent: `My journey into web development began just before high school graduation and evolved through hands-on experience. While university gave me a solid foundation in Software Engineering, real growth came from building side projects—starting with marketing websites and progressing to paid e-commerce work.
  
  Since then, I’ve collaborated on increasingly complex projects with diverse teams, thriving in dynamic, outcome-driven environments.`,
  
	whatIDo: `I specialize in frontend development with strong full-stack skills, recently expanding into mobile development using React Native. I focus on clean, maintainable code and building intuitive interfaces backed by scalable backend systems.`,
  
	howIWork: `My workflow is user-centered and visual. I begin by conceptualizing the experience, sketching ideas, and discussing interaction goals—then balance feasibility and technical clarity to bring those ideas to life.`,
  
	beyondCode: `Outside of tech, I enjoy making music (guitar, piano, vocals) and staying active through regular gym training. I'm looking to join a team that values growth, learning, and impactful design—particularly in frontend-focused roles.`,
